        <h2>How It Works.</h2>
        <p>
            The elo system is used in chess to rank players against each other, and has been adopted to many other games. This system is considered very fair due to it only benefitting players when they beat people that are also at their level. Players will gain
            more points if they beat someone with more points than them, and gain less if the person is lower than them.

            <div>Base Rank: 1200</div>

        </p>
        <h2>Why?</h2>

        <p>This project is an attempt to create a 1v1 competitive environment for tournament players to see how they line up versus other tournament players. I decided to make this project after seeing how one sided skillsets tended to be at higher ranks.
            Due to the randomness of the matchups this obviously isn't a sure fire way of telling someone's skill, but in a 1 vs 1 environment it should be a more accurate indicator than pp.
