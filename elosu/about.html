        <h2>How It Works.</h2>
        <p>
            The elo system is used in chess to rank players against each other, and has been adopted to many other games. This system is considered very fair due to it only benefitting players when they beat people that are also at their level. Players start at 1200
            elo and will drastically gain and lose points in their first few games. Players will gain more points if they beat someone with more points than them, and gain less if the person is lower than them. Due to players already being ranked on the
            osu leaderboards, points will be added to give lower level players a fighting chance againt new additions to the system. None of the numbers listed here are final:
            <div>Base Rank: 1000</div>
            <ul>
                <li> Rank 100,001 or lower = +0</li>
                <li> Rank 100,000 - 50,001 = +100</li>
                <li> Rank 50,000 - 25,001 = +200</li>
                <li> Rank 25,000 - 10,001 = +300</li>
                <li> Rank 10,000 - 5,001 = +400</li>
                <li> Rank 5,000 - 1,001 = +500</li>
                <li> Rank 1000 - 501 = +600</li>
                <li> Rank 500 - 101 = +700</li>
                <li> Rank 100 or higher = + 850</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>When a match is played the players must submit a multiplayer link and their stats will be put into a calculator to determine their new elo value.</p>
        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>This project is an attempt to create a 1v1 competitive environment for tournament players to see how they line up versus other tournament players. I decided to make this project after seeing how one sided skillsets tended to be at higher ranks.
